This was an assignment of the subject Natural Computing, described in the file `NC-TAREFACOMPUTACIONAL2-2019-2.pdf`(in portuguese).

# Run

Using `python 3`: 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

then:

`python main.py`

The code will run GA and PSO for 30 times each and show the boxplot for the accuracies found for the iris dataset.

# How the classifier works

The file `RelatorioComputacaoNatural2.pdf` reports how it was built (in portuguese).

This work was based on the paper [Implementing a Fuzzy Classifier and Improving its Accuracy using Genetic Algorithms](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0e3a/b04c83816c86c32466954e0febe629e0a542.pdf) with the same settings for the classifier, changing only the evolutionary algorithms.
